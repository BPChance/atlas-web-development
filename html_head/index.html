        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I enjoy listening to and making music.</p>
        <p>Favorite genre is R&B, but I like all music almost equally.</p>
        <p>I like to travel and experience different places.</p>
        <p>Staying home or inside is also great though!</p>

        <h4>My Cats</h4>
        <p>I have 2 outside cats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Camo</li>
            <li>Percy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unfortunately, no pictures of either, and it's raining as I'm making this so they're hiding!</p>
        <p>Instead I'll describe them, Camo is calico, which is why he is named Camo.</p>
        <p>Percy is striped gray with white boots, also important to note she is a dwarf. Very low to the ground kitty.</p>
